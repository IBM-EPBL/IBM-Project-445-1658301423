About the Smart Home Automation:
       The sensors connected to the microcontroller board are Smoke Detector, PIR, Ultrasonic  and LDR sensor. Smoke detector is used to sense the Gas,if gas is leaked 
       the Alarm circuit is active. The UltrasonicIs used for automatic open the front door if some someone is in front of the door. The PIR is used for detection of 
       human and turn ON the fan,also indicated using Red andGreen LED. Also the fan is controlled by manually. LDR is used for automatic light control in home if someone is in home at night the bulb is 
       automatically turned ON and at dey time it automatically turned OFF.
Things Required:
• Arduino UNO
• SMOKE DETECTOR MQ6
• PIR
• LDR
• ULTRASONIC
• Dc power source (Any 12v)
• Relay Board of 2 channel,2 LEDs and 3 Resistors
